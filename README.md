# Java_Progs

Welcome to **Java Progs** — a collection of Java programs I create and execute during my college lab practicals.  
This repository serves as my learning log, showcasing programs from the basics of Java to slightly advanced concepts.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo is mainly for:
- Storing all my lab practical codes
- Tracking my progress in Java
- Helping me (and maybe others) revise quickly before exams 😉

# ✏️ Notes
- All programs are tested before uploading.
- This repo will be updated regularly with new programs.
